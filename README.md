> a command line tool that provides bootstrap scripts to run all projects

Easily switch between projects that are written in different languages without having to remember how each language handles common tasks like installing dependencies, starting a server, and running the tests.

This project is an abstraction of the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/) pattern that is common at GitHub.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bkeepers/strappydoo.git ~/.strappydoo

```
